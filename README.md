# Implementation of a GAN

This is an example of a Generative Adverserial Network trained on MNIST Dataset. Check out the .ipynb file for the entire example and implementation.


### Generative Adverserial Network? 

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the hottest topics in deep learning. From a high level, GANs are composed of two components, a generator and a discriminator. The discriminator has the task of determining whether a given image looks natural (ie, is an image from the dataset) or looks like it has been artificially created. The task of the generator is to create natural looking images that are similar to the original data distribution, images that look natural enough to fool the discriminator network.
